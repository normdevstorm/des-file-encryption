March 2nd 2025
- I havent fully gain the control of my time, which leads to the waste of time in non-purpose activities
- Still not be able to force urself or even dread complying with the time schedule you have planned in advanced
- Havent kickstarted the ESSENCE IN 4 yet, esp for Caculus, the one you couldnt even scrape through twice
- >
- No matter what you gotta do, what written in plan needs implementing 
- Fuck what em people judge you, as long as you got the thing u want is of prime importance

March 3rd 2025, reflection
- I though I did found some interests in learning as long as the  beforehand prep was made. → Always prep beforehand to have a grasp whether firm or not → Not let urself feeling spcaced out and literally immersed in the lesson → no more sleepiness coming 
→ Pracetice to reinforce the knowledge → alleviate the burden towards the very end of the semester
- Still, it has been quite tough for me to really be stick to the original plan. What are the deep seated reasons lying behind that ? → What kind of a mantra would come in place once you feel that way again
→ You gotta do what you gotta do, you would have to thank urself if you , by all means, put work in it. 
→ Put it on the online calendar to remind u whats comin up next + mantra as description.
- Mathematics is still such a pain in my ass, partly because the shame derived from resitting the exam => don’t you ever let others’ judgement shaping the life u’re leading, u r the most important of all , and what matters the most is the ones matter to you the most.
