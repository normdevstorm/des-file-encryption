This is a yoctor initial note 
- A recipe for building the same os on another device
- Use for custom linux distribution esp for embedded devices
- What yoctor offers: Template + Tools + Methods + Working code
-> Choose hardware architecture -> Select the foorprint size -> remove and add components ->  Test on emulators
- Where to start	
+ Glossary/Terminology
Yoctor: act as an umbrella for efforts to improve the ebedded system
+ OpenEmbedded: the build system architecture
+ BitbBake: tool that reads metadata and run tasks
+ OE core: common base set of metadata that BitBake uses, This meta data is shared between OE and Yocto
+ Poky: reference distro/reference build host -  used for test and release purposes
+ Recipe: Metadata -define how bitbake is to confifgure, build and package a Yoctor project
+ Layer: a collection of Recipes and/or configuration used by bitbase => each layer is organized around a specific theme
------------------Acronyms
    BSP	Board Support Package
    CCB	Change Control Board
    PMP	Program Management Plan
    POR	Plan of Record
    PRD	Product Requirements Document
-----------------------------QEMU----------------------	
- The Quick Emulator is a free and open-source emulator that uses dynamic binary translation to emulate a computer's processor;
-i 
-----------------------------------LAYER------------------------
- Bitbake append file
- The source directory contains both general layer and BSP layer
- LAyer typically has names that begin with "meta-"
- Several layers are contained in the tree might namely be seen : meta, meta-skeleton, meta-selftest, meta-poky, and meta-yocto-bsp
- -----------Create layers---------------------

---------------------- COMMAND TO BUILD IMAGE WITH MOUNTED VOLUME ON HOST MACHINE-----------
- sudo apt update && sudo apt install iproute2 → to create net device
- docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $PWD/build:/home/yocto-user/yocto/output --cap-add NET_ADMIN --device /dev/net/tun bb4
